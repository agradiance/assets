Psalm 23, also known as the \"Shepherd Psalm,\" offers a message of God's care and presence during hardships, including lack and poverty. God, our Shepherd, provides for us so that we will not lack anything. He knows the terrain and will guide us to \"green pastures\" and \"quiet waters\" to replenish our spirit. We are encouraged to acknowledge our fears and challenges as the first step toward healing. The Shepherd promises to walk with us through the valley, not to remove it. God's presence is a constant source of comfort and strength, reminding us that we are not alone. The challenges will end, and a future filled with goodness, love, and an eternal dwelling place with God awaits. Holding on to this hope reminds us that our struggles are not the end and a brighter future awaits.",

            "content": "The people of Judah had returned from exile but neglected to rebuild the temple, preferring their own comfortable lives. They believed it wasn't the right time to rebuild the temple, but God saw their comfortable lives as misplaced priorities. The neglected temple symbolized their lack of devotion and appreciation for God's presence. Through the prophet Haggai, God challenged their lack of concern and urged them to consider their priorities and refocus their energy on rebuilding the temple. God reminded them that their lack of focus on rebuilding the temple resulted in a lack of blessing in their personal lives. We are asked if we are so focused on our comfort that we neglect things of greater importance, such as our relationship with God and service to others. While striving for a good life is important, neglecting our spiritual lives can lead to emptiness and a lack of fulfillment. Just as the people of Judah were called to rebuild the temple, God calls us today to take action and rearrange our priorities. We are challenged to \"Consider your ways!\".",

            "content": "Today's passage from Haggai offers guidance for when we make our best efforts but don't see the desired results. The passage begins with God urging Israel to examine their actions and priorities. After they do this, God instructs them to \"Go up into the mountains, bring down timber, and build my house\" (v.8). God recommended a shift from observation to action because reflection without action can lead to stagnation. The Israelites experienced a lack despite their efforts, and God explained this as a consequence of their focus on personal gain while neglecting his house. The drought and hardship they experienced were the result of their neglect. When we face challenges or a lack of fulfillment, we are told to take time to reflect on our actions and priorities. Reflection should be followed by action, and we should identify the changes we need to make to align our lives with God's will and actively pursue them. If we are unsure where to start, we should seek guidance from trusted spiritual leaders, mentors, or faith communities.",

God's response to their obedience was, \"I am with you, declares the Lord\" (v.13). The passage describes the positive outcomes of their obedience: their hearts were motivated to act and continue on the path of obedience with a deeper reverence for God. We are encouraged not to remain stagnant when we hear God's voice, but to take the first step toward what we believe God is asking of us, no matter how small. We are told to trust that as we move forward, He will be our guide and companion. Faith without action is like an unwatered seed, and we are encouraged to be the fertile ground where God's word can blossom into meaningful action.

This comparison between the magnificent former temple and its current, less impressive state might have brought feelings of regret and discouragement. However, God doesn't dwell on the past but encourages his people to move beyond it and focus on the blessings He promises in the present and future. It's okay to acknowledge and learn from the past, but dwelling on it can hinder our present and future growth. God's presence and blessings are available to us today, regardless of past experiences or circumstances. We are encouraged to focus on what we can control and how we can contribute to building something positive in the present. We shouldn't wait for ideal circumstances to begin building anew but should start with small, intentional steps, trusting that God will bless and guide our efforts. The text reminds us that while the past shapes who we are, it doesn't define our potential.

They might have questioned the value of their efforts, given the seemingly impossible task of rebuilding. In today's text, God offers reassurance despite their concerns. He encourages them to \"be strong\" and reminds them of his covenant, emphasizing his presence and unwavering support. The passage doesn't ignore the difficulties but offers a powerful promise: the shaking wasn't meant to destroy, but to prepare them for something new. This can be interpreted as a symbol of change and transformation, reminding us that God can use even difficult times to pave the way for something better. Verse 7 speaks of a time when \"the desire of all nations\" will come and fill the temple with glory, suggesting a future gathering of people from all backgrounds united in their reverence for God. The passage concludes with the promise that \"The glory of this latter house will be greater than the glory of the former house\" (v.9). Haggai's message reminds us that even in the face of difficulties and negative circumstances, God promises hope and a greater future glory.

Prayer is not just asking, but an act of relating and remaining in relationship with God. It is how we spiritually commune and connect with our heavenly Father and is one of the most effective weapons of our warfare. For our prayer to be effective, it must be done correctly and for the right purposes. The only correct, appropriate, and divinely approved prayer is the one done in the power of the Holy Spirit. As humans, we are physically weak, which often prevents us from praying, even when we desire to. We are also emotionally weak and don't know the correct needs to pray for, sometimes praying for things to fulfill lustful desires, selfish gain, and the satisfaction of ego. To pray correctly, we need the assistance and guidance of the Holy Spirit. We need the Holy Spirit to do the actual praying for us. To gain access to the Holy Spirit, we must allow the Spirit of God to dwell in us as we manifest the fruits of the Holy Spirit daily. Praying in tongues is another way the Holy Spirit helps our weaknesses in prayer; therefore, we need to thirst and hunger for the gift of praying in tongues.",

Mary is a significant figure in the Christian faith, but she should not be idolized or viewed as an object of worship. Although only God knows exactly why she was so favored and chosen, some suggest it was because she was a chaste virgin with sound morality, was very humble and simple-hearted, and had the Lord God of Israel as her Saviour. Today, God still has plans for the world, but to fulfill them, He looks for people who are prepared and morally sound, humble, and dedicated to service. If we are willing and ready to take part in God's plans, we should follow the example of Mary's life of humility, holiness, and followership of God.",

            "content": "In today's text, two questions were asked of the Priests. The first was whether a garment used to bear Holy Meat would become clean by touching Holy Meat, to which the answer was no. The second question was whether something unclean (by touching a dead body) can make something else clean (holy) become unclean, to which the answer was yes, meaning the unclean thing will defile a clean thing. The point emphasized by these questions is that it's easier to become unclean than to be made clean. As we interact with people and our environment, we need to be careful not to be defiled by immoral people we relate with. Some things that easily cause defilement are evil association and some often-overlooked sinful habits. The world today is full of wicked and sinful people whose lives are corrupted by habitual, ungodly, and criminal lifestyles. Some of these people give to charity, thinking they can use good works to erase their sins or make themselves clean, but this is not possible. The sure way to be cleansed from the guilt of sin is by honest confession, genuine repentance, and cleansing by the blood of the lamb.",

            "content": "This text builds on the preceding one, showing the people of Israel as unclean because they were selfish, laboring to build their own houses and please themselves while neglecting God's house. God told them that even though they claimed to have repented by laying the foundation of the temple, they would still suffer and endure the consequences of their sins for a moment. However, after their repentance and restitution, their situations would begin to change for the better. The penalty for their sin would eventually be removed, and a time of peace and joy would soon come. Sometimes the difficulties and challenges we face are a result of our disobedience and indifference to God's work. For example, financial hardship, debt, and business decline can be the result of not paying tithes and offerings. Likewise, certain physical health challenges may be a result of unconfessed and hidden sin. The good news is that we have the assurance of God's forgiveness and total restoration if we consider our ways and return to Him in sincere repentance. After our repentance, a moment of patience is needed as the time of punishment gradually winds off and we are fully restored.",

He will lead those who desire freedom from the bondage of sin and rule over them forever. The headquarters of his kingdom will be the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven and it will be established above all kingdoms. Jesus will reign as King from heaven over the whole universe.

The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews reveals that in ancient times, God spoke through the prophets, but in these last days, He chose to speak to us through His Son, Jesus Christ. The word of God through the prophets and later through Jesus was in perfect harmony. The word is of two kinds: 'foretelling' and 'forth-telling'. To forth-tell is to reveal God's will, mind, law, and instructions through verbal or written proclamation. To foretell is to reveal God's plans, program, and purpose for humanity and the entire universe. Jesus Christ, who is the word of God, came into the world and revealed God's mind and law. He also made known God's plans and purpose for the whole world. He called everyone to repentance and faith in God and revealed the ultimate purpose and plan of God for the salvation of mankind. His followers are called to proclaim this gospel. When Jesus ascended into heaven, he handed over the work of proclaiming the word of God to us.

They offered animals that were torn, lame, sick, or maimed, which was a violation of God's prescription concerning offerings. Today, many of our altars are polluted with different forms of abominable sacrifices. Many priests, who should be custodians of the altar, are 'Strangers in the Sanctuary' because they have no salvation experience and their hands are soiled with sin. Many songs we sing and prayers we offer today are nothing but abominable sacrifices. When we offer polluted sacrifices to God, terrible consequences will follow, as seen in the case of Nadab and Abihu, who offered strange fire before the Lord.

Jesus also says, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself first, and take up his cross daily, and follow me\". There is a popular saying: \"No cross, no crown\". On the cross, Jesus Christ suffered beyond description, but He also conquered sin, self, satan, and all challenges that are man's problems, including curses, sicknesses, diseases, failures, and death. Furthermore, it was on the cross that Christ brought salvation to those who believe in him. Paul referred to 'the enemies of the cross' as those who do not walk according to the mind of Christ but according to the desires of the flesh. Jesus received the greatest honor because He surrendered himself, despised the shame, and died the meanest of forms of death. Paul said, \"God forbids that I should glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ\". Any man identified with the cross of Christ has the world and its evil desires crucified with him and is risen to a new life of holiness and righteousness with him. A crucified life is a dignified and glorified one, and we are encouraged not to dodge the cross but to carry it gallantly, as the blessings attached to it await us.",

Being joint heirs with Christ qualifies believers to enjoy the great inheritance that we have in God. This inheritance is manifested in two ways: first in the glory that shall be revealed to the world and second in the suffering the believer will have to go through for the sake of his faith.

Therefore, in all our ambitions in life, we must acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives so our existence can be meaningful and impactful.

Verses 17-21 expand on this, contrasting those who follow Christ and those who live for earthly things. Apostle Paul presents a clear choice before the believers - either to live for this world or the Kingdom of Heaven. He further challenges all believers to examine their priorities and motivations. Our priorities determine who we are. As heavenly citizens, our focus must be on the things of heaven. We must note that true fulfillment comes only from belonging to God's eternal kingdom and living for that purpose alone. This doesn't mean that we will neglect our earthly responsibilities but rather we find our ultimate meaning in Christ and live a balanced life, using all resources around us to fulfill the purpose of getting to heaven.

Christ's lifting here is not of the humiliating death on the cross but of a deeper meaning, symbolising Jesus' purpose - to offer himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of mankind. This reveals the heart of God's love and redemption plan. Jesus didn't shy away from his crucifixion, He saw it as the transformative power of sacrifice, and not humiliation. In the earlier chapter (8:12), Jesus described himself as \"The light of the world,\" without which anyone who walks, is in darkness. Phos is a Greek word for light, meaning anything that produces brightness. Light is anything that reveals things or makes them manifest. Darkness is the absence of darkness. According to John Piper, \"The light of Christ is the brightness of God shining on the retina of the human soul\". He is the light to both the Jews and the Gentiles. Isaiah describes the desperate and hopeless state of a man without Jesus, the Light. Beloved, will you be drawn to this wonderful love? Have you tasted Calvary? Today is the day, tomorrow may be too late!.",

He emptied himself, was shed of the honours and glories of the upper world and clothed himself with human nature. One would have thought that the Lord Jesus if He would be a man, should have been a prince, and appeared in splendour. But quite the contrary, He took upon himself the form of a servant.

This is because no one can, on his or her ability, obey the Law perfectly. There were over 600 laws the Jews had to keep so as to be right in the eyes of God; breaking one commandment put a person under condemnation. Therefore, achieving salvation through obedience to the Law is fruitless. As a result, all who tried to live by the Old Law were under a divine curse. The good news is that Christ, through his death on the cross, provided a way out of this curse, making the way for us to regain the favour of God. He did this by becoming a curse for us - for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hangs on a tree.'. The curse of the law fell on Christ on our behalf so that the righteousness of God could fall on us, though we did not deserve it. He took away our sins and curses so that the blessings of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through him. Every man is condemned and cursed but the redemptive grace of Jesus brought us all into favour and blessings of God, and we can access this grace by believing in the Lord Jesus and living by faith to receive the blessings that accompany faithful observance of the law.",

As a result of this, they were hated by the Jews because of their reputation for cheating and because they supported Rome.

Jesus hurt his reputation among the religious elites to reach out to those who were lost. We must all follow our Master's example by spreading the gospel to all without any discrimination - the poor, immoral, lonely and outcast, and not just the rich, moral, popular and powerful. We should not be afraid to reach out to people who are living in sin. God's message changes people and He is concerned for all people, including the sinful and hurting. Matthew, on hearing the call to abandon all and follow Jesus, got up and followed, leaving the so-called lucrative career, without any regret.

This most excellent way is the way of kindness, longsuffering, and enduring evil, injury or provocation. In this way, pride and vainglory are subdued and there is no room for envy, hatred, malice, or revenge. Love is the fulfillment of all the laws of God and once we allow the love of God to spread over us, our hearts will be transformed and we will receive the impartation of the agape love. However, this will only be possible if we allow the light of the gospel to bring the knowledge of Christ to inspire faith and hope in us which will help us to set aside our natural desires so that we can love and not expect anything in return. Thus, the more we become like Christ, the more love we will show to others. This will help us to understand that love is the greatest of all human qualities and an attribute of God himself.",

This message also holds valuable lessons for all of us called to leadership roles, whether within the church or in our daily lives. God entrusted the priests with the task of being guardians and teachers, ensuring God's instructions reached the people. However, God laments that the priests have scattered his instructions \"to the wind\" and \"turned away\" from the covenant. This neglect has consequences. God threatened to \"curse their blessings\" and \"spread dung over their faces\". As leaders, religious or secular, we hold a great responsibility. We are entrusted with guiding others, shaping their understanding, and setting an example. When we fail to uphold our responsibilities, the consequences can be great. We risk misleading those we are called to serve, and our influence can be tarnished. Our passage today highlights that the Levite priests of old were committed to their calling and served with integrity. Today's leaders are challenged to reflect on old-time faith and leaders, follow their example, embody the values they preach, and guide others with honesty and dedication. Our actions speak louder than words. If we don't live by the principles we advocate, we \"cause many to stumble in the law\".",

It is important to remember that God's refining fire is not meant to destroy us but to remove impurities and reveal the precious metal within. Just as a refiner carefully heats gold to separate it from dross, so does God work in our lives to remove sin and selfishness, leading us closer to his holiness.

The verses highlight the importance of commitment and faithfulness through the concept of tithes and offerings. This isn't just about material things, but also about recognizing that everything we have comes from God and expressing our gratitude and trust through our actions. However, in the midst of the warnings, God offers hope. He invites the people to return and to test his faithfulness through generosity. He also promises abundant blessings if they return. Imagine a farmer questioning the value of planting seeds due to past droughts. Our passage reminds us that God, unlike seasons, remains reliable. He is the ever-present source of blessings, waiting for us to cultivate our trust through faithful actions. Are we questioning God's promises like the people in Malachi?.

However, as we obey the will of God in showing this love, we are going to face persecution, suffering, and conflict. As Christians, we are called to respond with blessings, perseverance, and a commitment to peace.

Yet, Jesus equipped the disciples with clear instructions and powerful promises and their message was one of hope and healing, proclaiming the arrival of the Kingdom of Heaven. Rejection and persecution were expected, but the disciples were not to respond negatively. This reminds us to stand firm in our faith while maintaining peace and love, even in the face of opposition.

While it is not wrong to desire to be a leader in God's house, it must never be at all costs. It is interesting to note that there are qualifications for leaders, as we see in today's passage. For one, the person must have a good testimony (within and outside the church), and there are ways to measure this. For one, he must be gentle, not quarrelsome. It may be easy for many not to be quarrelsome outside. But what about at home?. A quarrelsome man at home, often in disagreement with his wife and other family members, is not qualified to lead God's people. A man known for quick temper should also not aspire for leadership office in God's house. Moreover, one who is desiring the office of a bishop must be humble. Pride is what ruined Satan and can also destroy a Christian leader. Pride has to do with an open consciousness of your perceived worth; it has to do with an over-emphasised opinion of one's self.

He eventually made it and discovered he felt no different. He thought a Master's degree would give him that boost; he finished his masters and discovered the world did not change. A Ph.D might just be the magic he needed; but he finished that also without feeling on top of the world. As he discovered, only a proper relationship with Christ gave him the inner joy he needed to move through life. This experience has been the story of many. And the reason is very simple: He (Jesus) is before all things, and in him alone all things hold together (v.17). Even life itself cannot hold together outside him. The pursuit of worldly goods and achievements do no guarantee ultimate happiness; political power does not guarantee it either. Same goes for fame. We were created for him, and only in him can we ever find fulfillment.

Hear Paul again firmly insisting: \"As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith\" (vv. 6-7). A few implications emerge here as what is required once you receive Christ: (i) Walk in him: You are no longer allowed to walk/live the way you want; your steps must now be clearly taken in Christ, not according to the expectations of the world system. Your life can no longer be lived to fulfil the expectations of men, not even your own personal expectations, but the expectations of Christ. Are you living according to his expectations?.

My worry is that this belief has created fear in the minds of many a Christian; it seems to be elevating the powers of evil; and it gets Christians preoccupied with activities to stop 'village people' rather than bearing a authentic witness for Christ. Is this not a contradiction?. What Scripture clearly teaches, point in a very different direction: \"... having wiped out the handwriting of ordinances against us, which was contrary to us\" (v. 14). No sin is greater than the blood of Christ; his blood can cleanse any sin. No power, covenant or curse is greater than the cross of Christ; his cross brought us victory over all the powers of the evil one.

In other words, when a person genuinely gives his/her life to Christ, he/she first of all dies to the worldly attitude to life; and is then raised with Christ to the heavenly attitude towards life. Being born-again involves a drastic disconnection in the attitude towards the world and its manner of living, and a another drastic connection in attitude towards heaven and its manner of living. Attitude is what makes the difference!. Those who are truly raised with Christ and are genuinely born-again demonstrate that new status by their lifestyles, passions and desires. On the other hand, those who are not born-again, or who only pretend to be, are identified by the way their passions and desires cling to the world and all it offers. Such people are often willing to compromise godly moral standards in order to gain the treasures of the world.

First, wives are instructed to submit themselves to their husbands, and this is fitting and pleasing to the Lord. In a world filled with twisted cultural mindsets and the theories of feminism, it is becoming increasingly hard for many wives to obey this principle. But if a Christian family must glorify God, this principle is a must. Note that the wife is called upon to submit herself to her husband willingly and not by force. Her action should be a free-will decision because she loves the Lord. A wife cannot truly love Christ without showing that love through submission to her husband. Second, husbands are to love their wives the way Christ loved his Church and gave himself up for her (Eph. 5:25). This is a self-giving and self-sacrificing kind of love. Moreover, Christian children are to obey their parents ; and parents are to raise and train their children with firmness, patience and love.",

God was challenging them to see their condition of slavery as an opportunity to showcase their faith as Christians. They were therefore instructed to be obedient to their masters in everything, as long as it did not go against the principles of their faith. They were not to give themselves to eye-service, but be sincere and diligent in carrying out their duties. They were to always view their work as an opportunity for service, not to men but to God, knowing that God is the ultimate rewarder. Slavery may not be in practice among us today literally as it was then, but what about our work ethic today? Do you grumble, murmur and complain in your place of service?

James believed only after the resurrection - when Jesus showed himself to him. That was enough to convert him. James realised that he had been wrong all along. He later became a leader in the church at Jerusalem, so much so that Paul referred to him as a pillar of the church. God used James to do a lot for his church in Jerusalem. James contributed a lot towards the resolution of the controversial issue at the Jerusalem Council. His leadership was steady, mature, and based on Scripture. James' story shows what God's grace can do in a person's life. It can take an unbeliever and turn them into a devoted servant of the Lord as it did to James (from doubting Jesus to leading the most influential church in Jerusalem and guiding and defending God's people with God's Word). If Jesus did it for James, He will do it for them too. Only let your knees be bent in prayer on their behalf. Pray that they will be saved while God's grace lasts.",

A guilty conscience is a relentless pursuer, driving a person to flee from imaginary threats and to avoid unseen eyes. This is the case of the wicked who engages in praising wickedness, oppression, and injustice because of selfishness. Even when no one is actually threatening them, the wicked, prompted by a guilty conscience, shame and fear of judgment, become fearful and suspicious of everyone. This happens to them because God is not pleased with them. God's righteous ones are however confident and bold - standing even when persecuted for Christ's sake. They are bold as a lion because God upholds them. They know that his grace is bigger than any mistake, and his forgiveness more powerful than any guilt. You can be bold and courageous by turning to Christ who sets free from all sin, guilt, shame and fear. Jesus washes from all wickedness and makes the righteous face anything with confidence and boldness. Dip yourself in the truth of God's love. When you understand the depth of his love for you, guilt loses its grip. When you realise that you are covered by his grace, fear dies.",

They also honour God with their lives, recognising that they will stand before him to be judged based on their faithfulness as believers (2 Cor. 5:10). Thus, they do not lead God's children astray (v.10) , do not boast in their wealth (v.11) , praise righteous deeds, are just and fair, and administer justice to all when in leadership (vv. 12, 15). They quickly confess and forsake their sins (v.13). The man who fears the Lord will be honoured in due time by the Lord, if not in this life, then in eternity. Those who fear the Lord sow seeds of life and will have a glorious harvest with abundant spiritual fruit and rewards. They will have access to every spiritual blessing and eternal riches in Christ. The fear of God begins with accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour. Those who harden their hearts and reject Christ will find disaster and eternal catastrophe as they are judged on the last day. Their eternity will be misery in hell.

Such shortcuts include favouritism, bribery, neglecting the needy, taking advantage of others, stealing, etc. These all result in false riches and have consequences. True riches come from honest hard work and showing kindness and love towards others in need. Be careful that you do not run into trouble. Be on guard against all kinds of greed and shortcuts to wealth. Such wealth is false and does not last. Seek to be rich toward God thereby laying up treasure for yourself in heaven. Through honest hard work and love, built in your heart for the poor and needy, God will supply your needs (Phil. 4:19) ; and this will not be taken away from you.

Beloved, there may be many people around you that are not truly saved. But while you pray for their salvation, do not judge them. Just heed the warnings of Scripture and contend for the faith as the apostles did. If this faith matters to you, and if it defines you, and it is a priority for you, you will be obliged to defend it.

Unfortunately, some Christians are frustrated as it appears the wicked seem to get away with their sins without consequences. Some wonder why they should abstain from evil. But remember, there is always a consequence to your choices. If you choose to be wicked, God will deal with you in his time and in his way. If you choose to ignore God's ways, hurting those around you, eventually, you will face the consequences of your choice in this life or in eternity. God will surely deal with those who choose to sin. Nobody will ever escape the consequences of their choices (Psa. 37:1-6). When you see sin multiplying, run from it and trust God to deal with it in his time and in his way.

It feels powerful, but its power is deceptive. That's why Proverbs 29:25 tells us, 'The fear of man brings snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD shall be safe.'  This means that the fear of man is an evil trap. That is why both Moses and Jesus commanded us to love and fear the Lord, not man (Deut. 6:5; Matt 22:37). Remember, you obey the one that you fear and you ascribe the most authority to the person you fear most. As a Christian, you are to fear God and seek the eternal reward and approval that He gives. Fear the terrible eternal curse of God's disapproval more than insignificant man's disapproval. The fear of the Lord is safe because He really is God and He alone can destroy both the soul and body in hell. Lay aside every fear of man by confessing your fear of man as sin to God, and repent.

Whenever you find Andrew in John's gospel, he is bringing somebody to Jesus: his brother, the lad with the loaves and fish (John 6:8-9), and the Greeks who wanted to see Jesus (John 12:20-21). No sermons from Andrew are recorded, but he certainly preached great sermons by his actions as a personal soul winner.

No matter how difficult life may be, a man of hope will get going. Our passage today speaks of the manner of love that God has for his children, and the expectation of being like Christ when we shall behold him at the end of time. The idea of becoming like Christ fascinated John so much that he was ready to pay any price to actualise it. This was the ground of his hope; it was not temporal but completely eternal. In the hope of being like Christ, he was willing to pursue the purity required. The evidence of our sincere desire to becoming like Christ is seen in our commitment to be pure.

From John's account in this passage, sin can NOT accompany the spiritual birth. Sin cannot co-exist with a believer who is born of the spirit. John stresses two important issues, which I can term the \"drug and vaccination\" against sin. The vaccination is the issue of the spiritual birth which deposits a part of God - the seed of God - in us. The drug is the fact that we remain in Christ. This is the ANTIDOTE to sin.

At the exit gate of death, love is the ticket required for passage. Love is that thing that empties a man (v.17), even of his blood, for the sake of his neighbour. The language of love is sacrifice; it is expressed not in word but in deed. There is no price it cannot pay; there is no gate it cannot open; there is no weakness it cannot tolerate; there is no offence it cannot forgive and there is no evil it cannot overcome. A demonstration of love is an assurance that we are living in the truth of God's word and it is the insurance of our hearts in the presence of God.

It explains the adequacy of his representation as the holy contact by which our humanity meets God. A part of the Nicene Creed is dedicated to this truth. It states that \"he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary, and was made man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.\"  The acceptance of his substitutionary death - taking the place of man - is built on the fact that He was FULLY man. So, the teaching of Docetism (denying the reality of Christ's full humanity), goes to the root of our salvation. This truth of Christ's full humanity also brings out the humiliation he undertook for our redemption; that God was made man. It also made Christ a PERFECT EXAMPLE as one who has shared a common experience and has become touched by the feelings of our infirmities. The implication of these is that on the last day; no man shall be with any excuse of not living the victorious Christian life. It is possible and it has been proven.",

However, though all who sat in darkness saw the great light, there was no guaranty that they all left darkness. Though darkness did not comprehend the light, the light did not \"kill\" darkness. Darkness left the public space where the light appeared and entered into the private residence prepared by men who loved darkness.

Rather than being influenced by the city, Mary radically altered the historical perspective of the place and giving birth to Jesus here permanently changed the outlook of the city, in time and in eternity.

However, Mary received the message with faith (v.38b). Indeed, God is the Creator of all things and can alter what He has created. He can break into natural laws and cause the supernatural to happen. Like Mary, we need faith that opens up new dimensions, making us understand that what we see is not all there is, and that with God all things are possible.

And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together as it is the habit of some, but encouraging one another... (Hebrew 10: 24-25). Consequent upon Mary's angelic visitation as we have read in previous days (v 28-37), she thought it wise to visit her cousin Elizabeth to felicitate with her and possibly to render any needed assistance during her prenatal days (remember Elizabeth was pregnant at old age) (v7,24-6,39 & 56). However, a causal Christian fellowship soon gave birth to another dimension of spiritual edification and empowerment (v41-55). Friend, do you think Mary had it in her mind that her visit to her cousin was going further establish what Angel Gabriel said to her prior to the visit?  No, she simply went to fellowship!  Our horizontal fellowship with one another is as important as our vertical relationship with God. There are many benefits we stand to derive from it ; ranging from physical (services, encouragement, financial empowerment and bailouts, conflict resolution, sharing burden, correction and advise, etc.) to spiritual (intercession, Bible study, words of wisdom, etc.).",

Simeon could now die (breathe his last breath) in peace after seeing Jesus, who is the salvation of Israel (v.29). Beloved, like Simeon, we must resolve to have a personal encounter with Jesus before we take our last breath and depart this world. Not to do so is to miss the inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade — an inheritance kept in heaven for Christians (1 Pet. 1:4). Be reminded that there is no repentance in the grave. Now is the day of salvation; tomorrow may be too late.",

            "content": "We all pray to live long on earth. The Bible promises to grant the enjoyment of long life to those who honour their parents (Deut. 5:16 cf Eph. 6:2-3). The Lord also promises his continued love and never-ceasing care for the elderly when He says, “Even to your old age, I am He, And even to gray hairs I will carry you! I have made, and I will bear; Even I will carry, and will deliver you” (Isa. 46:4). We can see Anna hold on to this promise of being sustained by the Lord at old age, to serve Him. The grace of God was truly upon her, true to her name ‘Anna’ which means 'grace.'  Her age has been variously reckoned from 84 to 105 years since she had been married for seven years, following which she had been a widow, either for 84 years or until her eighty-fourth year. Notice that even at very old age, she did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day (v.37). Let us pray the Father to bestow this same grace that was upon Anna on the aged ones today. It is not good that at retirement age, we become unproductive, especially in God's service. Grace makes the difference at old age, for we can still stay fresh and green.",

But we can also talk about what God did not send His Son into the world to do: \"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him\" (v.17). Yes, God did not send Jesus to condemn the world. Isn't that good news? Of course! This verse underlines for those who have doubts about the Christian faith who God really is. Many assume that God is always keen to 'condemn', but John is clear that the opposite is true. We are confronted with the challenge of our sinful state which requires judgement and condemnation. But we see in the whole of Scripture, God's redeeming plan which centres on the coming of Jesus. So, every Christian has the task of helping those who are confused about who God is and what He is like. Some think their sins are too grievous to be forgiven; that God had already condemned them. However, the God who sent His Son not to condemn the world but to save it, is the God of love, goodness and grace, and He desires to be our friend and lead us in abundant living. Jesus did not come to condemn the world - here is the message to share at Christmas.",

No other god can speak to our condition because no other god ever became flesh! This Jesus who is God became flesh and dwelt among men. It is remarkable that God himself would be this perfect sin-saving, peace-giving, light-shining leader, who would live among us and die to unite us fully with God. We gasp at such a revelation, but it's true. The Word has become flesh. And that is the meaning of Christmas. Can you see why we should sing our favourite carol today from the rooftops, as loudly as we dare, celebrating God's great love in sending Jesus?  Let the Christmas Word who has become flesh be our perfect teacher so that in his life, we may see how God thinks and how we should think. Let Him be our perfect example as a model of what we are to become, to show us how to live and give us the power to live that way ; and let him be our perfect sacrifice - He who came as a sacrifice for all sins, that his death may satisfy God's requirements for the removal of our sins.",

He is recorded as standing out from the others in faith, grace, spiritual power, and wisdom (Acts 6:5, 8, 10). Stephen truly knew Christ and the power of his resurrection and participated in His sufferings, becoming like him in his death. Just as false accusations were brought against Jesus (Matt. 26:59-61; Mark 14:57-59), leading to his crucifixion, so too Stephen was falsely accused (Acts 6:11,13,14), and subsequently executed (Acts 7:58). Stephen prayed (Acts 7:60) as Jesus had done (Luke 23:34) for his persecutors to be forgiven. He also committed his soul into Christ's keeping (Acts 7:59) as Jesus committed his spirit into the Father's hands (cf. Luke 23:46). He met his end courageously, as Jesus, his Master, did. Stephen imitated Christ to the letter, hence we can say of him, \"Like Christ, like Stephen.\"  Every Christian has been called to imitate Christ. After all, every Christian is a follower of Christ (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Pet. 4:16). As we continue in the celebration of Christmas, put your name in the blank space provided here and see whether it fits in like that of Stephen: \"Like Christ like ....\" If it fits, praise God; and if not, pray to God passionately to be like Christ.",

John's intimacy with Jesus earned him the expression, 'the disciple Jesus loved', such that he could lean on Jesus' breast at supper (John 21:20). The results of John's intimacy with Jesus include: (1) Being the first of the apostles to believe in the resurrection on the basis of what he saw in the empty tomb (John 20:8). (2) It was his insight that detected the risen Lord as the one responsible for the great catch of fish (John 21:7). (3) In Galatians 2:9, he is counted as a pillar of the Jerusalem church, along with Peter and James. (4) He wrote the Gospel according to St John (v.24), the three epistles of John, and the book of Revelations, all of which testify about Jesus. John's intimacy with Jesus as the beloved disciple helped him learn to understand the very heart of Jesus and do exploits for the kingdom. We can also become \"beloved disciples\" when we commune with Jesus through constant prayer, regular study of the Scriptures and fellowship with fellow believers. As we do so, the eyes of our hearts will be enlightened in order that we may know the hope to which the Lord has called us, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people (Eph. 1:18).",

            "content": "There is the popular saying that \"When you fail to plan, you plan to fail.\"  When we read through the Book of Acts, we will discover that trials were common to first-century Christians. Some were mobbed, imprisoned, and even killed as a result of their faith. Knowing that persecution will certainly arise against Christians, Jesus had to prepare the minds of his followers in this regard, promising to send his Spirit to strengthen them when it happens (Luke 12:11-12). Here, Peter writes to encourage Christians who are suffering, not because of any wrongdoing of theirs, but as a result of attack on their faith, not to see suffering as \"some strange thing\" (v.12). This is not to say Christians should pray to encounter suffering. Far from it! Rather, they should expect it and prepare for it. Honestly, God's plan for your life may include pain and hardship. So, when trouble comes, don't be surprised but see it as a test of faith. James enjoins us to consider it \"pure joy\" when we face trials of many kinds (James 1:2). A sure way to prove that you are prepared when suffering comes, is not to ask God \"why me?\", but to ask Him to show you \"how\" you can use the suffering to glorify Him.",

The children are innocent because they had done no wrong to warrant their deaths. In the midst of the rejoicing that a Saviour had been born (Luke 2:10-11), Matthew pauses to mark the heartbroken grief of the mothers who had lost their children as a result of Herod's jealousy (Matt. 2:13-18). Though Baby Jesus escaped the killings, which is good, the other babies paid the price of an evil man in a position of power. Just as it was a time of rejoicing when Jesus was born as well as a period of mourning because of the innocent young souls murdered, so too we have mixed feelings when we celebrate Christmas today. While some have joyful time with church and family, others have painful times full of loneliness and sorrow. When we face great pain, we need others to lament with us and mark those anniversaries. As the jollity of Christmas continues, let's pause like Matthew to remember those who face great pain and loss, whether that loss was yesterday or decades ago which becomes fresh in their memories every Christmas because it occurred during this season in time past.

Very imperfect human beings we are - unconsciously displaying our imperfections sometimes. Therefore, we all need help from Christ, the perfect One, who has commanded us to be perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect (Matt. 5:48). Good enough, grace and truth came through Christ to us (v.17). Do you know we have received from Christ grace that teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions? (Titus 2:11,12) . Do you also know that we have received grace that helps us to reign through righteousness? (Rom. 5:21) . Know it that we can grow to a stage in our spiritual development where there is far more grace than ungrace, and far more truth than untruth (cf 1 Pet. 3:18).
