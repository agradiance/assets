            "content": "Life sometimes leads us through valleys of darkness, filled with challenges, losses, and uncertainties[cite: 1, 6]. Psalm 23, also known as the \"Shepherd Psalm,\" offers a message of God's care and presence during hardships, including lack and poverty[cite: 2]. God, our Shepherd, provides for us so that we will not lack anything[cite: 3]. He knows the terrain and will guide us to \"green pastures\" and \"quiet waters\" to replenish our spirit[cite: 4, 5]. We are encouraged to acknowledge our fears and challenges as the first step toward healing[cite: 7]. The Shepherd promises to walk with us through the valley, not to remove it[cite: 8]. God's presence is a constant source of comfort and strength, reminding us that we are not alone[cite: 9, 10]. The challenges will end, and a future filled with goodness, love, and an eternal dwelling place with God awaits[cite: 10]. Holding on to this hope reminds us that our struggles are not the end and a brighter future awaits[cite: 11, 12].",

            "content": "The people of Judah had returned from exile but neglected to rebuild the temple, preferring their own comfortable lives[cite: 15, 18]. They believed it wasn't the right time to rebuild the temple, but God saw their comfortable lives as misplaced priorities[cite: 16]. The neglected temple symbolized their lack of devotion and appreciation for God's presence[cite: 17]. Through the prophet Haggai, God challenged their lack of concern and urged them to consider their priorities and refocus their energy on rebuilding the temple[cite: 19]. God reminded them that their lack of focus on rebuilding the temple resulted in a lack of blessing in their personal lives[cite: 20]. We are asked if we are so focused on our comfort that we neglect things of greater importance, such as our relationship with God and service to others[cite: 22]. While striving for a good life is important, neglecting our spiritual lives can lead to emptiness and a lack of fulfillment[cite: 23]. Just as the people of Judah were called to rebuild the temple, God calls us today to take action and rearrange our priorities[cite: 24, 25]. We are challenged to \"Consider your ways!\"[cite: 26].",

            "content": "Today's passage from Haggai offers guidance for when we make our best efforts but don't see the desired results[cite: 28, 29]. The passage begins with God urging Israel to examine their actions and priorities[cite: 30]. After they do this, God instructs them to \"Go up into the mountains, bring down timber, and build my house\" (v.8)[cite: 31]. God recommended a shift from observation to action because reflection without action can lead to stagnation[cite: 32]. The Israelites experienced a lack despite their efforts, and God explained this as a consequence of their focus on personal gain while neglecting his house[cite: 33]. The drought and hardship they experienced were the result of their neglect[cite: 34]. When we face challenges or a lack of fulfillment, we are told to take time to reflect on our actions and priorities[cite: 35]. Reflection should be followed by action, and we should identify the changes we need to make to align our lives with God's will and actively pursue them[cite: 36, 37]. If we are unsure where to start, we should seek guidance from trusted spiritual leaders, mentors, or faith communities[cite: 38].",

Having heard God's word, they shifted their focus and took action, highlighting the importance of not just listening but also acting on what we hear[cite: 41, 42]. God's response to their obedience was, \"I am with you, declares the Lord\" (v.13)[cite: 43]. The passage describes the positive outcomes of their obedience: their hearts were motivated to act and continue on the path of obedience with a deeper reverence for God[cite: 45]. We are encouraged not to remain stagnant when we hear God's voice, but to take the first step toward what we believe God is asking of us, no matter how small[cite: 46, 47]. We are told to trust that as we move forward, He will be our guide and companion[cite: 48]. Faith without action is like an unwatered seed, and we are encouraged to be the fertile ground where God's word can blossom into meaningful action[cite: 49, 50]. Small steps of obedience can lead to significant changes in our lives and strengthen our relationship with God[cite: 52].

This comparison between the magnificent former temple and its current, less impressive state might have brought feelings of regret and discouragement[cite: 56]. However, God doesn't dwell on the past but encourages his people to move beyond it and focus on the blessings He promises in the present and future[cite: 57]. It's okay to acknowledge and learn from the past, but dwelling on it can hinder our present and future growth[cite: 58, 59]. God's presence and blessings are available to us today, regardless of past experiences or circumstances[cite: 60]. We are encouraged to focus on what we can control and how we can contribute to building something positive in the present[cite: 61]. We shouldn't wait for ideal circumstances to begin building anew but should start with small, intentional steps, trusting that God will bless and guide our efforts[cite: 62]. The text reminds us that while the past shapes who we are, it doesn't define our potential[cite: 63].

            "content": "The Israelites felt discouraged by the temple's current state compared to its former glory[cite: 66]. They might have questioned the value of their efforts, given the seemingly impossible task of rebuilding[cite: 67]. In today's text, God offers reassurance despite their concerns[cite: 68]. He encourages them to \"be strong\" and reminds them of his covenant, emphasizing his presence and unwavering support[cite: 69]. The passage doesn't ignore the difficulties but offers a powerful promise: the shaking wasn't meant to destroy, but to prepare them for something new[cite: 70, 71]. This can be interpreted as a symbol of change and transformation, reminding us that God can use even difficult times to pave the way for something better[cite: 72]. Verse 7 speaks of a time when \"the desire of all nations\" will come and fill the temple with glory, suggesting a future gathering of people from all backgrounds united in their reverence for God[cite: 73, 74]. The passage concludes with the promise that \"The glory of this latter house will be greater than the glory of the former house\" (v.9)[cite: 76]. Haggai's message reminds us that even in the face of difficulties and negative circumstances, God promises hope and a greater future glory[cite: 77]. We are encouraged to hold onto this hope, embrace change, and actively contribute to building a brighter future, trusting in God's presence and guidance every step of the way[cite: 78].",

Prayer is not just asking, but an act of relating and remaining in relationship with God[cite: 82]. It is how we spiritually commune and connect with our heavenly Father and is one of the most effective weapons of our warfare[cite: 83, 84]. For our prayer to be effective, it must be done correctly and for the right purposes[cite: 85]. The only correct, appropriate, and divinely approved prayer is the one done in the power of the Holy Spirit[cite: 87]. As humans, we are physically weak, which often prevents us from praying, even when we desire to[cite: 88]. We are also emotionally weak and don't know the correct needs to pray for, sometimes praying for things to fulfill lustful desires, selfish gain, and the satisfaction of ego[cite: 89, 90]. To pray correctly, we need the assistance and guidance of the Holy Spirit[cite: 91]. We need the Holy Spirit to do the actual praying for us[cite: 92]. To gain access to the Holy Spirit, we must allow the Spirit of God to dwell in us as we manifest the fruits of the Holy Spirit daily[cite: 93]. Praying in tongues is another way the Holy Spirit helps our weaknesses in prayer; therefore, we need to thirst and hunger for the gift of praying in tongues[cite: 94, 95].",

Through her, the work of human salvation was achieved through Jesus Christ[cite: 99]. She conceived and gave birth to the eternal King whose kingdom will have no end[cite: 100]. Mary is a significant figure in the Christian faith, but she should not be idolized or viewed as an object of worship[cite: 101]. Although only God knows exactly why she was so favored and chosen, some suggest it was because she was a chaste virgin with sound morality, was very humble and simple-hearted, and had the Lord God of Israel as her Saviour[cite: 103, 104, 105, 106]. Today, God still has plans for the world, but to fulfill them, He looks for people who are prepared and morally sound, humble, and dedicated to service[cite: 107].

The first was whether a garment used to bear Holy Meat would become clean by touching Holy Meat, to which the answer was no[cite: 112, 113]. The second question was whether something unclean (by touching a dead body) can make something else clean (holy) become unclean, to which the answer was yes, meaning the unclean thing will defile a clean thing[cite: 114, 115]. The point emphasized by these questions is that it's easier to become unclean than to be made clean[cite: 116]. As we interact with people and our environment, we need to be careful not to be defiled by immoral people we relate with[cite: 118]. Some things that easily cause defilement are evil association and some often-overlooked sinful habits[cite: 119]. The world today is full of wicked and sinful people whose lives are corrupted by habitual, ungodly, and criminal lifestyles[cite: 120, 121]. Some of these people give to charity, thinking they can use good works to erase their sins or make themselves clean, but this is not possible[cite: 122, 123]. The sure way to be cleansed from the guilt of sin is by honest confession, genuine repentance, and cleansing by the blood of the lamb[cite: 124].",

God told them that even though they claimed to have repented by laying the foundation of the temple, they would still suffer and endure the consequences of their sins for a moment[cite: 127]. However, after their repentance and restitution, their situations would begin to change for the better[cite: 128]. The penalty for their sin would eventually be removed, and a time of peace and joy would soon come[cite: 129]. Sometimes the difficulties and challenges we face are a result of our disobedience and indifference to God's work[cite: 130]. For example, financial hardship, debt, and business decline can be the result of not paying tithes and offerings[cite: 131]. Likewise, certain physical health challenges may be a result of unconfessed and hidden sin[cite: 132]. The good news is that we have the assurance of God's forgiveness and total restoration if we consider our ways and return to Him in sincere repentance[cite: 133].

In this text, Zerubbabel is used as a symbolic representation of the Messiah, the Eternal King to come[cite: 139]. As Zerubbabel was the initial leader of the exiles, Jesus, of the Davidic dynasty, will be the Deliverer of all who seek to escape from the captivity of sin[cite: 141]. He will lead those who desire freedom from the bondage of sin and rule over them forever[cite: 142]. The headquarters of his kingdom will be the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven and it will be established above all kingdoms[cite: 143].

The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews reveals that in ancient times, God spoke through the prophets, but in these last days, He chose to speak to us through His Son, Jesus Christ[cite: 149]. The word of God through the prophets and later through Jesus was in perfect harmony[cite: 150]. The word is of two kinds: 'foretelling' and 'forth-telling'[cite: 151]. To forth-tell is to reveal God's will, mind, law, and instructions through verbal or written proclamation[cite: 152]. To foretell is to reveal God's plans, program, and purpose for humanity and the entire universe[cite: 153]. Jesus Christ, who is the word of God, came into the world and revealed God's mind and law[cite: 154]. He also made known God's plans and purpose for the whole world[cite: 155]. He called everyone to repentance and faith in God and revealed the ultimate purpose and plan of God for the salvation of mankind[cite: 156, 157]. His followers are called to proclaim this gospel[cite: 157]. When Jesus ascended into heaven, he handed over the work of proclaiming the word of God to us[cite: 158].

They offered abominable sacrifices on God's altar, which was an abomination to God and His people[cite: 163, 164]. They offered animals that were torn, lame, sick, or maimed, which was a violation of God's prescription concerning offerings[cite: 164]. Today, many of our altars are polluted with different forms of abominable sacrifices[cite: 165]. Many priests, who should be custodians of the altar, are 'Strangers in the Sanctuary' because they have no salvation experience and their hands are soiled with sin[cite: 166]. Many songs we sing and prayers we offer today are nothing but abominable sacrifices[cite: 167]. When we offer polluted sacrifices to God, terrible consequences will follow, as seen in the case of Nadab and Abihu, who offered strange fire before the Lord[cite: 168].

On the cross, Jesus Christ suffered beyond description, but He also conquered sin, self, satan, and all challenges that are man's problems, including curses, sicknesses, diseases, failures, and death[cite: 174]. Furthermore, it was on the cross that Christ brought salvation to those who believe in him[cite: 174]. Paul referred to 'the enemies of the cross' as those who do not walk according to the mind of Christ but according to the desires of the flesh[cite: 175]. Jesus received the greatest honor because He surrendered himself, despised the shame, and died the meanest of forms of death[cite: 176]. Paul said, \"God forbids that I should glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ\"[cite: 177]. Any man identified with the cross of Christ has the world and its evil desires crucified with him and is risen to a new life of holiness and righteousness with him[cite: 177].

The Spirit of God bears witness with our Spirit that we are children of God, and such are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ[cite: 179, 180]. Being joint heirs with Christ qualifies believers to enjoy the great inheritance that we have in God[cite: 181]. This inheritance is manifested in two ways: first in the glory that shall be revealed to the world and second in the suffering the believer will have to go through for the sake of his faith[cite: 182].

God's power is to reconcile and restore man, and can only be traced back to Jesus Christ, who has been since the foundation of the world[cite: 1]. Paul also described Jesus Christ in the last part of verse 24 of our text as the wisdom of God[cite: 1]. Power and wisdom are essential in life for anybody who wants to succeed here and beyond[cite: 1]. We will be powerless, foolish, and unfulfilled if Jesus Christ is absent in our lives because worldly wisdom is foolishness to God[cite: 1]. Therefore, in all our ambitions in life, we must acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives so our existence can be meaningful and impactful[cite: 1]. The level of our academic attainment or exposure is vanity if Jesus Christ is not in our lives[cite: 1]. Since the power and wisdom of God is Jesus Christ, then anyone aiming to see God at the end must do away with sinful living and surrender all to Jesus Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God[cite: 1].",

In verses 15-16, he calls for the Philippians to follow his example and those living faithfully[cite: 1]. In the same way, we are to follow the examples of Saints in their commitment and faithful living[cite: 1]. We must intentionally live with the purpose of modeling our lives to follow the pattern of Jesus Christ[cite: 1]. Verses 17-21 expand on this, contrasting those who follow Christ and those who live for earthly things[cite: 1]. Apostle Paul presents a clear choice before the believers - either to live for this world or the Kingdom of Heaven[cite: 1]. He further challenges all believers to examine their priorities and motivations[cite: 1]. Our priorities determine who we are[cite: 1]. As heavenly citizens, our focus must be on the things of heaven[cite: 1]. We must note that true fulfillment comes only from belonging to God's eternal kingdom and living for that purpose alone[cite: 1]. This doesn't mean that we will neglect our earthly responsibilities but rather we find our ultimate meaning in Christ and live a balanced life, using all resources around us to fulfill the purpose of getting to heaven[cite: 1].

The world saw the crucifixion of Jesus as a defeat but Jesus saw it as a means of victory[cite: 1]. Instead of lamenting his fate, He declares with confidence \"If I be lifted up, I will draw all men to myself\"[cite: 1]. Christ's lifting here is not of the humiliating death on the cross but of a deeper meaning, symbolising Jesus' purpose - to offer himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of mankind[cite: 1]. This reveals the heart of God's love and redemption plan[cite: 1]. Jesus didn't shy away from his crucifixion, He saw it as the transformative power of sacrifice, and not humiliation[cite: 1]. In the earlier chapter (8:12), Jesus described himself as \"The light of the world,\" without which anyone who walks, is in darkness[cite: 1]. Phos is a Greek word for light, meaning anything that produces brightness[cite: 1]. Light is anything that reveals things or makes them manifest[cite: 1]. Darkness is the absence of darkness[cite: 1]. According to John Piper, \"The light of Christ is the brightness of God shining on the retina of the human soul\"[cite: 1]. He is the light to both the Jews and the Gentiles[cite: 1]. Isaiah describes the desperate and hopeless state of a man without Jesus, the Light[cite: 1].

One would have thought that the Lord Jesus if He would be a man, should have been a prince, and appeared in splendour[cite: 1].

This is because no one can, on his or her ability, obey the Law perfectly[cite: 1]. There were over 600 laws the Jews had to keep so as to be right in the eyes of God; breaking one commandment put a person under condemnation[cite: 1]. Therefore, achieving salvation through obedience to the Law is fruitless[cite: 1]. As a result, all who tried to live by the Old Law were under a divine curse[cite: 1]. The good news is that Christ, through his death on the cross, provided a way out of this curse, making the way for us to regain the favour of God[cite: 1]. He did this by becoming a curse for us - for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hangs on a tree.'[cite: 1]. The curse of the law fell on Christ on our behalf so that the righteousness of God could fall on us, though we did not deserve it[cite: 1]. He took away our sins and curses so that the blessings of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through him[cite: 1]. Every man is condemned and cursed but the redemptive grace of Jesus brought us all into favour and blessings of God, and we can access this grace by believing in the Lord Jesus and living by faith to receive the blessings that accompany faithful observance of the law[cite: 1].",

At the time, tax collectors were expected to take a commission on the taxes they collected, but most of them overcharged the people and kept the excess to themselves[cite: 1]. As a result of this, they were hated by the Jews because of their reputation for cheating and because they supported Rome[cite: 1]. Despite this, our Lord Jesus Christ still went for Matthew, a man who would have been regarded as an oppressor and a terrible sinner, by the Jews[cite: 1]. Jesus hurt his reputation among the religious elites to reach out to those who were lost[cite: 1]. We must all follow our Master's example by spreading the gospel to all without any discrimination - the poor, immoral, lonely and outcast, and not just the rich, moral, popular and powerful[cite: 1]. We should not be afraid to reach out to people who are living in sin[cite: 1]. God's message changes people and He is concerned for all people, including the sinful and hurting[cite: 1]. Matthew, on hearing the call to abandon all and follow Jesus, got up and followed, leaving the so-called lucrative career, without any regret[cite: 1].

This most excellent way is the way of kindness, longsuffering, and enduring evil, injury or provocation[cite: 1]. In this way, pride and vainglory are subdued and there is no room for envy, hatred, malice, or revenge[cite: 1]. Love is the fulfillment of all the laws of God and once we allow the love of God to spread over us, our hearts will be transformed and we will receive the impartation of the agape love[cite: 1]. However, this will only be possible if we allow the light of the gospel to bring the knowledge of Christ to inspire faith and hope in us which will help us to set aside our natural desires so that we can love and not expect anything in return[cite: 1]. Thus, the more we become like Christ, the more love we will show to others[cite: 1].

We risk misleading those we are called to serve, and our influence can be tarnished[cite: 1]. Our passage today highlights that the Levite priests of old were committed to their calling and served with integrity[cite: 1]. Today's leaders are challenged to reflect on old-time faith and leaders, follow their example, embody the values they preach, and guide others with honesty and dedication[cite: 1].

We do the right things because we belong to the Lord, who is not disorderly; we do the right things because it is the right thing to do; we do the right things because we fear God and for the sake of our conscience[cite: 1]. Verse 5 of our text stresses it: Therefore, you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience sake[cite: 1]. Note the word 'must'; it is actively playing a crucial role there[cite: 1]. So, you must do what is good[cite: 1]. You're supposed to have, as up to date, it is Christian to do so[cite: 1].

In our communion, it seems many in the holy orders see the bishopric as the ultimate that must be aspired for, and campaigned for, if necessary[cite: 1]. The word 'bishop' in our passage can mean overseer[cite: 1]. While it is not wrong to desire to be a leader in God's house, it must never be at all costs[cite: 1]. It is interesting to note that there are qualifications for leaders, as we see in today's passage[cite: 1]. For one, the person must have a good testimony (within and outside the church), and there are ways to measure this[cite: 1]. For one, he must be gentle, not quarrelsome[cite: 1]. It may be easy for many not to be quarrelsome outside[cite: 1]. But what about at home?[cite: 1]. A quarrelsome man at home, often in disagreement with his wife and other family members, is not qualified to lead God's people[cite: 1]. A man known for quick temper should also not aspire for leadership office in God's house[cite: 1]. Moreover, one who is desiring the office of a bishop must be humble[cite: 1]. Pride is what ruined Satan and can also destroy a Christian leader[cite: 1]. Pride has to do with an open consciousness of your perceived worth; it has to do with an over-emphasised opinion of one's self[cite: 1].

Your life can no longer be lived to fulfil the expectations of men, not even your own personal expectations, but the expectations of Christ[cite: 1].
